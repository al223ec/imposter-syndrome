    and pass it along. Something else to notice is how we don't need the data to construct our function
    in the pointfree version, whereas in the pointful one, we must have our word available before anything else.

/*  Pointfree code can again, help us remove needless names and keep us concise and generic. Pointfree is a good
    litmus test for functional code as it lets us know we've got small functions that take input to output. One
    can't compose a while loop, for instance. Be warned, however, pointfree is a double-edged sword and can
    sometimes obfuscate intention.
